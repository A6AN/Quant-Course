# Brownian Motion & Random Walks

Imagine a single grain of dust floating in a sunbeam. It doesn't move in a straight line. It darts about randomly - up, down, left, right - as invisible air molecules bump into it. This chaotic, unpredictable dance is called Brownian Motion.

In the 1900, a french mathematician named Louis Bachelier had a brilliant idea: what if stock prices move in the same way? Not because of air molecules, but because of the random arrival of news and the random buy & sell orders of thousands of investors.

This idea is called the Random Walk Hypothesis. It states that the next move in a stock price is completely independent of its past moves. The fact that the Nifty 50 went up yesterday gives you no real information about whether it will go up or down today. Its steps are random.

The simple idea has a profound consequence: it's impossible to consistently predict short-term market movements based on price alone.

So, when we talk about Brownian Motion in finance, we're using it as the mathematical engine to generate this randomness. It's the "random" part of our stock prices model.

Think of it as the building block of uncertainty in our financial models. It's a process that is continuous in time but zig-zags so erratically that its "speed" (or derivative in the classic sense) is infinite. This is a very weird but important property that forces us to use special tools.

Random Walk Hypothesis is what we call a foundational model or a null hypothesis. It's the simplest possible explanation for the market, and is the baseline that any complex strategy must prove it can beat.
