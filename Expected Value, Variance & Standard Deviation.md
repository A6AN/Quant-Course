# Expected Value, Variance & Standard Deviation


Expected Value: The "mean" or "average" you learned in school is what you calculate from data you already have. Expected Value is the "average" you can expect from a random variable in the future, taking into account the probabilities of all possible outcomes. It's a probability-weighted average.

The formula is $E(X)=∑{(Probability  of  Outcome)×(Value  of  Outcome)}$

Example: Imagine a simplified stock scenario. You believe there is a,

- A 60% probability of a +10% return

- A 40% probability of a -5% return


The expected value of your return is: 
`(0.60×10%)+(0.40×−5%)=6%−2%=4%`
So on Average, you can expect a 4% return from this investment on many trials.

Now while the expected return is 4%, the actual outcomes are either +10% or -5%. Neither is close to 4%. This tells us there's risk or dispersion. To measure this, we use Variance & Standard deviation.

Variance: This measures how far, on average, each outcome is from the Expected value. A bigger variance means the outcomes are very spread out.

Standard Deviation: This is simply the square root of variance. We use it because it is much more intuitive. If your returns are in percent, the standard deviation is also in percent. It is the single most common measure of risk or volatility in finance.

When we discussed the Normal Distribution, we used a mean (μ) & the standard deviation (σ). The expected value is our forward-looking estimate for the mean & the standard deviation is our measure for how wide the bell curve will be.
