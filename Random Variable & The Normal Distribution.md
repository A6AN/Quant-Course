# Random Variable & The Normal Distribution

In algebra, x is a constant. A random variable is different. It's a placeholder for a future, uncertain outcome. For example, let's define a random variable X (capital letter by convention) as: X = The percentage return of the Nifty 50 tomorrow. We don't know what X will be. It could be +1.3%, −0.81% or +0.05%. It is a variable whose value is the outcome of a random event. Now, the crucial question is: Could some of these outcomes be more likely than a return of +10%?

This is where a distribution comes in. A probability distribution is a chart or function. A probability distribution is a chart or function that tells us the likelihood of all the possible values of our random variable. If we looked at the last 20 years of daily returns for the Nifty 50 and plotted them on a histogram, we'd get a picture of its historical distribution. It might look something like a hill or a normal distribution.

The most famous & important of all distribution is the Normal Distribution (also known as the "Bell Curve").

It is a symmetric curve defined by just two things:

1. The Mean (μ): The center of the curve. This is the average value, or the most likely outcome. For Nifty 50 daily returns, this would be a number slightly above zero.

2. The Standard Deviation (σ): The "width" of the curve. A small standard deviation means the outcomes are tightly clustered around the average (a calm, predictable stock). A large standard deviation means the outcomes are very spread out (a volatile, risky stock).


The Normal Distribution is the starting point for almost all financial modeling because it often does a decent job of describing stock returns. It gives us a powerful rule of thumb called the '68-95-99.7 rule'.

- There's a ~68% chance that the outcome will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean.

- There's a ~95% chance it will be within 2 S.d

- There's a ~99.7% chance it will be within 3 S.d


In plain - extreme events are rare. So if we say Nifty 50 Returns are roughly normally distributed with a mean of 0.08% & S.d of 1%. We can say there is a 95% probability that tomorrow's return will be somewhere between -1.92% & 2.08%.
